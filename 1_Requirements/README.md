## Introduction

* Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques used to encrypt data into unintelligible nonsense(ie plaintext to ciphertext) during communication to protect it from the prying eyes of unauthorized parties.
* It has various aspects such as authentication, data integrity and data confidentiality.
* Modern day cryptography is very complex and is an interdisplinary topic that includes mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering and many more.
* In this mini-project, certain simple substitution cryptography techniques will be implemented using C programming.
* In substitution ciphering techniques plaintext is converted to ciphertext in a defined manner using a key; a unit may be single letter, pair of letters or more.
* Some examples of substitution ciphers are Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher and Playfair cipher

## Research
### Substitution Ciphers

Although substitution ciphering techniques(by themselves) are no longer be used in modern day for encryption purposes due to being easy to crack(for computers), they are still commonly used in puzzles, coding and decoding question and simple games.
